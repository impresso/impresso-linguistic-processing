# Information on impresso linguistic preprocessing

This repository implements the following linguistic processing steps:

- POS tagging
- NER tagging
- improved lemmatization

We do this for the following languages:

- fr
- de
- lb (only POS tagging)
- en

The Luxembourgish language model is taken from
https://github.com/PeterGilles/Luxembourgish-language-resources/tree/master/lux-tagger-July2023/model-best
und unknown licencing status. We set the version and name in the model's meta data to lux-tagger-July2023.

## Prerequisites

The build process has been tested on modern Linux and macOS systems and requires
Python 3.11. Under Ubuntu/Debian, make sure to have the following packages installed:

```sh
# install linux tools and python3.11 according on Debian/Ubuntu
sudo bash cookbook/install_apt.sh

# on macos with brew
sudo bash cookbook/install_brew.sh
```

This repository uses `pipenv`.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/impresso/impresso-linguistic-processing.git
cd impresso-linguistic-processing
python3.11 -mpip install pipenv
python3.11 -mpipenv install
python3.11 -mpipenv shell
```

For s3-based file processing, the following environment variables need to be set:

```sh
SE_ACCESS_KEY=
SE_SECRET_KEY=
SE_HOST_URL=
```

If your global environment does not contain these variables, you can set them in a local
`.env` file. The `python-dotenv` package is used to read these variables.

```sh
cp env.sample .env
edit .env
```

# Running the pipeline

## Local configuration

Adapt the local paths for the input and output directories in the
`config.local.mk` (see `config.local.mk.sample` for default settings.)

```sh
cp config.local.mk.sample config.local.mk
edit config.local.mk
```

## Available Make targets

The build process is controlled by the `Makefile`. Main targets include:

```sh
make help                    # show available targets
make setup                   # initialize development environment
make newspaper               # process specific newspaper/year pairs in parallel
make collection              # process all newspapers
make clean                   # clean build artifacts
make clean-build             # remove all generated files
```

## Processing options

For newspaper processing, several options are available:

```sh
# Process with specific parallelism
make newspaper MAKE_PARALLEL_OPTION=16

# Process specific newspapers
make newspaper NEWSPAPERS="GDL IMP"

# Process specific years
make newspaper YEARS="1900 1901"

# Combine options
make newspaper NEWSPAPERS="GDL" YEARS="1900" MAKE_PARALLEL_OPTION=8
```

## Command-Line Options for `spacy_linguistic_processing.py`

The `lib/spacy_linguistic_processing.py` script supports several command-line options:

- `--lid`: Path to the language identification file.
- `--language`: Specify a language code to use for all items.
- `-o`, `--output-path`: Path to the output file (default: `out.jsonl`).
- `--min-doc-length`: Minimum document length to process (default: 50).
- `--validate`: Validate the final language identification JSON against the schema.
- `--text-property`: Specify the JSON property that contains the full text (default: `ft`).
- `--git-version`: Set the git version to include in the output. If not set, the `GIT_VERSION` environment variable is used.
- `--quit-if-s3-output-exists`: Quit if the output file already exists in the specified S3 bucket.
- `--s3-output-path`: S3 path to upload the output file after processing or check if it already exists.
- `--keep-timestamp-only`: After uploading to S3, keep only the timestamp of the local output file for data efficiency.

## Build System Structure

The build system is organized into several make include files:

- `config.local.mk`: Local configuration overrides (not in the repository)

# Uploading to impresso S3 bucket

Ensure that the environment variables `SE_ACCESS_KEY` and `SE_SECRET_KEY` for access to the
S3 impresso infrastructure are set, e.g., by setting them in a local `.env` file.

The build process uploads the processed data to the impresso S3 bucket.

# Processing Workflow Overview

This overview explains the impresso linguistic preprocessing pipeline, focusing on efficient data processing, distributed scalability, and minimizing interference between machines.

## Key Features

### Data Storage on S3

All input and output data reside on S3, allowing multiple machines to access shared data without conflicts. Processing directly from S3 reduces the need for local storage.

### Local Stamp Files

Local **stamp files** mirror S3 metadata, enabling machines to independently track and manage processing tasks without downloading full datasets. This prevents interference between machines, as builds are verified against S3 before processing starts, ensuring no overwrites or duplicate results.

### Makefile and Build Dependencies

The Makefile orchestrates the pipeline by defining independent targets and dependencies based on stamp files. Each machine maintains its local state, ensuring stateless and conflict-free builds.

### Running Local Commands

Processing scripts operate independently, handling data in a randomized order. Inputs are read from S3, outputs are uploaded back to S3, and no synchronization is required between machines. Additional machines can join or leave without disrupting ongoing tasks.

### Uploading Results to S3

Processed files are validated locally and uploaded to S3 with integrity checks (e.g., JSON schema validation and md5sum). Results are never overwritten, ensuring consistency even with concurrent processing.

### Handling Large Datasets on Small Machines

By leveraging S3 and stamp files, machines with limited storage (e.g., 100GB) can process large datasets efficiently without downloading entire files.

### Parallelization

- **Local Parallelization**: Each machine uses Make's parallel build feature to maximize CPU utilization.
- **Distributed Parallelization**: Machines process separate subsets of data independently (e.g., by newspaper or date range) and write results to S3 without coordination.

### Multi-Machine Build Isolation

- **Stateless Processing**: Scripts rely only on S3 and local configurations, avoiding shared state.
- **Custom Configurations**: Each machine uses local configuration files or environment variables to tailor processing behavior.

## Summary

The impresso pipeline ensures scalable, distributed processing by:

- Using **S3 for centralized storage** and avoiding shared local state.
- Leveraging **local stamp files** for machine-specific tracking.
- Defining **independent Makefile targets** for parallel builds.
- Employing **stateless scripts** that operate independently.
- Ensuring **concurrent data handling** through S3â€™s consistency features.

This architecture supports efficient, isolated builds, enabling multiple machines to process large datasets seamlessly and reliably.
